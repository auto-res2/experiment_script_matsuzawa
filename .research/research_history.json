    "summary": "Generative models based on latent variables, such as generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs), have gained lots of\ninterests due to their impressive performance in many fields. However, many\ndata such as natural images usually do not populate the ambient Euclidean space\nbut instead reside in a lower-dimensional manifold. Thus an inappropriate\nchoice of the latent dimension fails to uncover the structure of the data,\npossibly resulting in mismatch of latent representations and poor generative\nqualities. Towards addressing these problems, we propose a novel framework\ncalled the latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN) that fuses the Wasserstein\nauto-encoder and the Wasserstein GAN so that the intrinsic dimension of the\ndata manifold can be adaptively learned by a modified informative latent\ndistribution. We prove that there exist an encoder network and a generator\nnetwork in such a way that the intrinsic dimension of the learned encoding\ndistribution is equal to the dimension of the data manifold. We theoretically\nestablish that our estimated intrinsic dimension is a consistent estimate of\nthe true dimension of the data manifold. Meanwhile, we provide an upper bound\non the generalization error of LWGAN, implying that we force the synthetic data\ndistribution to be similar to the real data distribution from a population\nperspective. Comprehensive empirical experiments verify our framework and show\nthat LWGAN is able to identify the correct intrinsic dimension under several\nscenarios, and simultaneously generate high-quality synthetic data by sampling\nfrom the learned latent distribution.",

    "main_contributions": "The paper introduces Latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN), a novel framework that adaptively learns the intrinsic dimension of data distributions supported on manifolds. It fuses Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (WAE) and Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) to improve generative modeling quality and representation learning by learning a latent normal distribution whose rank is consistent with the dimension of the data manifold. The paper provides theoretical guarantees on the generalization error bound, estimation consistency, and dimension consistency of LWGAN.",
    "methodology": "LWGAN combines WAE and WGAN in a primal-dual iterative algorithm. It utilizes a deterministic encoder Q: X -> Z to learn an informative prior distribution PZ ~ N(0, A), where A is a diagonal matrix characterizing the intrinsic dimension of the latent space. A generator G: Z -> X is combined with Q to generate images using the latent code Z. The 1-Wasserstein distance is used to measure the similarities between distributions. The 1-Lipschitz constraint on the critic f is enforced by the gradient penalty technique.",
    "experimental_setup": "The framework is validated through comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic datasets (S-curve, Swiss roll, Hyperplane) and benchmark datasets (MNIST, CelebA). The experiments demonstrate LWGAN's ability to detect the intrinsic dimensions for both simulated examples and real image data and generate high-quality samples. The performance is evaluated using Inception Score (IS), Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), and reconstruction errors.",
    "limitations": "The paper focuses on scenarios where the data lies on a topological manifold. The generator G is deterministic. The method's sensitivity to the choice of neural network architecture and hyperparameters (e.g., gradient penalty parameter, rank regularization parameter) is not fully explored.",
    "future_research_directions": "Future research directions include investigating a more general scenario where the generator G is stochastic by adding an extra noise vector to its input. Incorporating the stochastic LWGAN into more recent GAN modules such as BigGAN to produce high-resolution and high-fidelity images along with the estimation of the intrinsic dimension is suggested. Application of LWGAN to structural estimation in economics is also proposed."

In the context of this\nreality, existing diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face\nchallenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain.\nTo address this limitation, we conceptualize images as sequences of tokens with\ndynamic sizes, rather than traditional methods that perceive images as\nfixed-resolution grids. This perspective enables a flexible training strategy\nthat seamlessly accommodates various aspect ratios during both training and\ninference, thus promoting resolution generalization and eliminating biases\nintroduced by image cropping. On this basis, we present the \\textbf{Flexible\nVision Transformer} (FiT), a transformer architecture specifically designed for\ngenerating images with \\textit{unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios}. We\nfurther upgrade the FiT to FiTv2 with several innovative designs, includingthe\nQuery-Key vector normalization, the AdaLN-LoRA module, a rectified flow\nscheduler, and a Logit-Normal sampler. Enhanced by a meticulously adjusted\nnetwork structure, FiTv2 exhibits $2\\times$ convergence speed of FiT. When\nincorporating advanced training-free extrapolation techniques, FiTv2\ndemonstrates remarkable adaptability in both resolution extrapolation and\ndiverse resolution generation. Additionally, our exploration of the scalability\nof the FiTv2 model reveals that larger models exhibit better computational\nefficiency.

In addition, we replace the purely deterministic generator in LWGAN with a partially stochastic one to capture richer variations. Concretely:\n\n1. Adaptive Latent Dimensionality\n   ‚Ä¢ As in LWGAN, we learn a diagonal covariance matrix A for the latent normal distribution so that its rank matches the estimated intrinsic dimension of the data manifold.\n   ‚Ä¢ We retain the encoder network Q : X ‚Üí Z and the generator G : Z ‚Üí X to map between data space and latent space.\n\n2. Isometric Regularization\n   ‚Ä¢ Drawing from Isometric Representation Learning, we introduce a distance-preserving term into LWGAN‚Äôs objective. It encourages the generator G to respect local distances so that small latent-space changes map to mild changes in output images, improving smoothness and interpretability of the latent space.\n   ‚Ä¢ This is done by penalizing discrepancies between pairwise distances in latent space and pairwise distances in the corresponding generated samples. A stochastic trace estimator can be used to make this distance-based penalty computationally feasible on minibatches.\n\n3. Partially Stochastic Generator\n   ‚Ä¢ Instead of the purely deterministic generator from LWGAN, we add a noise injection step inside G. Specifically, we feed G with both the encoded latent code z as well as a small random perturbation Œµ. The magnitude of Œµ is controlled by a parameter that can be tuned to improve coverage of multimodal data while avoiding instability.\n   ‚Ä¢ This partial stochasticity addresses the concern that a purely deterministic mapping may struggle with highly multimodal distributions.\n\n4. Training Objective\n   ‚Ä¢ We keep LWGAN‚Äôs Wasserstein-based adversarial objective with gradient penalty or spectral normalization (as in typical WGAN formulations).\n   ‚Ä¢ We add the isometric-regularization loss term, weighted by a hyperparameter Œªiso, to penalize violations of local geometric fidelity.\n   ‚Ä¢ We preserve dimension adaptivity and consistency via the diagonal-matrix parameterization A, enforcing the learned latent dimension to match the data manifold‚Äôs dimension.\n\n5. Advantages and Novelty\n   ‚Ä¢ The adaptive-dimension aspect of LWGAN and the new geometric penalty jointly yield an expressive yet well-structured latent space, mitigating the risk of ‚Äúlatent mismatch‚Äù reported in the Base Method.\n   ‚Ä¢ The partial noise injection broadens the model‚Äôs expressiveness, helping handle diverse or multimodal distributions with fewer mode-collapse issues.\n   ‚Ä¢ Importantly, Iso-LWGAN moves beyond a mere partial tweak: it adds a geometry-aware step that redefines how the latent space is learned and also introduces generator stochasticity‚Äîyielding a new paradigm that merges adaptive latent dimension learning (from LWGAN) with isometric constraints and richer variability in generation.\n\nIn this way, Iso-LWGAN addresses several weaknesses of the Base Method (latent mismatch, purely deterministic generation, and fragile generalization) by drawing upon the isometric representation idea from the ‚ÄúAdd Method‚Äù and introducing additional stochasticity into the generator.",

Experiment 3: Overall Performance Comparison between Iso-LWGAN and Base LWGAN\n\n‚Ä¢ Goal: Show that the new elements in Iso-LWGAN (isometric regularization and partial noise injection) lead to an overall enhancement in generative performance, both in terms of quantitative metrics and latent space quality.\n\n‚Ä¢ Setup:\n  - Use a benchmark dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom synthetic dataset whose intrinsic dimensionality is known) and implement both the Base LWGAN and Iso-LWGAN (with a well-tuned Œªiso and appropriate noise level).\n  - Ensure that both models are training with similar settings (same optimizer, batch size, etc.) to provide a fair comparison.\n\n‚Ä¢ Measurements:\n  - Compute quantitative metrics such as FID, Inception Score, or any custom metric relevant to the task.\n  - Assess the adaptation of the latent space by checking the learned diagonal covariance matrix A (e.g., verifying that its effective rank reflects the known intrinsic dimension of the dataset).\n  - Perform latent space interpolations and measure consistency (by computing distances) alongside qualitative visual assessment.\n  - Optionally, run ablation studies to see the contribution of each component (regularization term and stochasticity).\n\n‚Ä¢ Expected Outcome:\n  - Iso-LWGAN should achieve lower FID scores and more stable training curves.\n  - The latent space should be smoother and more interpretable, with controlled variability in outputs due to partial stochasticity.\n  - These results would support the claim that Iso-LWGAN overcomes the latent mismatch and failures observed in the Base Method.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nImplementation Considerations:\n\n‚Ä¢ Code can be structured using PyTorch‚Äôs modules for building the generator, encoder, discriminator, etc. Utilize efficient minibatch computation for the isometric loss (e.g., using torch.cdist for pairwise distances and a stochastic trace estimator for large batches).\n\n‚Ä¢ Experiment logging can be handled via tools like TensorBoard or Weights & Biases to capture loss curves, metric histories, and visual samples for consistent comparisons.\n\n‚Ä¢ Hyperparameters (Œªiso, œÉ_noise, learning rates, etc.) can be tuned via grid search or Bayesian optimization if needed, depending on resource availability.\n\nThis experimental plan is fully implementable in Python and is designed to be both realistic in scope and rigorous in demonstrating how the new method (Iso-LWGAN) provides tangible advantages over the previous LWGAN approach.",

Implement two models:\n   ‚Ä¢ The Base LWGAN using the architecture and losses from the provided research code.\n   ‚Ä¢ The Iso-LWGAN variant, which adds the isometric regularizer from Experiment 1 and the partial noise injection from Experiment 2.\n3. Ensure that both models share the same training hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc.) for a fair comparison.\n4. Optionally include ablation studies: (a) Base LWGAN, (b) Base + only isometric penalty, (c) Base + only noise injection, and (d) full Iso-LWGAN.\n\nMeasurements:\n‚Ä¢ Quantitative metrics: For image datasets use FID or Inception Score. For lower-dimensional data, you might compute reconstruction loss and measure the effective rank (or diagonal variance) of the learned latent covariance.\n‚Ä¢ Latent Space Analysis: Visualize interpolations and compute pairwise distance differences (as in Experiment 1) to assess smoothness and geometric fidelity.\n‚Ä¢ Training stability: Record loss curves for both the generator and discriminator losses.\n‚Ä¢ Ablation: Compare how removal or inclusion of each component affects performance.\n\nExample Implementation Code (Experiment 3):\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nimport torchvision\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter\n\n# Assume similar definitions for SimpleEncoder, SimpleGenerator, etc. are reused.\n# For MNIST, let's define simple networks (taking images flattened to vectors).\n\nclass MNISTEncoder(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, z_dim):\n        super(MNISTEncoder, self).__init__()\n        self.net = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Flatten(),\n            nn.Linear(28*28, 256), nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(256, z_dim)\n        )\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.net(x)\n\nclass MNISTGenerator(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, z_dim, noise_dim=10, partial_noise=False):\n        super(MNISTGenerator, self).__init__()\n        self.partial_noise = partial_noise\n        input_dim = z_dim + (noise_dim if partial_noise else 0)\n        self.net = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(input_dim, 256), nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(256, 28*28), nn.Tanh()\n        )\n    def forward(self, z, sigma_noise=0.1):\n        if self.partial_noise:\n            noise = torch.randn(z.size(0), 10) * sigma_noise\n            z = torch.cat([z, noise], dim=1)\n        return self.net(z).view(-1, 1, 28, 28)\n\n# Load MNIST dataset\ndef load_mnist(batch_size=128):\n    transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])\n    trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\n    loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)\n    return loader\n\ndef train_comparison_model(model_type=\"Base\", num_epochs=20, z_dim=20, lambda_iso=1.0, sigma_noise=0.1):\n    # model_type options: \"Base\", \"Iso\" (i.e., uses isometric reg and noise injection)\n    loader = load_mnist(batch_size=128)\n    encoder = MNISTEncoder(z_dim)\n    # For base model, disable partial noise\n    partial_noise_flag = True if model_type==\"Iso\" else False\n    generator = MNISTGenerator(z_dim, noise_dim=10, partial_noise=partial_noise_flag)\n    \n    writer = SummaryWriter(log_dir=\"./runs/\"+model_type)\n    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(list(encoder.parameters())+list(generator.parameters()), lr=1e-3)\n    \n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        for i, (x, _) in enumerate(loader):\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            z = encoder(x)\n            # In Iso-LWGAN, we add noise injection and isometric loss\n            x_gen = generator(z, sigma_noise=sigma_noise) if partial_noise_flag else generator(z)\n            recon_loss = torch.mean(torch.norm(x.view(x.size(0), -1) -

Experiment 1 shows that the isometric regularization term produces a latent space that preserves distances, leading to smoother generated outputs.\n2. Experiment 2 confirms that controlled noise injection helps in capturing multimodal distributions and reduces mode collapse.\n3. Experiment 3, using a benchmark dataset like MNIST, demonstrates that combining these two innovations results in an overall performance improvement relative to the Base LWGAN.\n\nEach experiment is implemented using PyTorch and leverages existing libraries to ensure efficiency and reproducibility. Logging via TensorBoard (or similar tools) can be used for quantitative and qualitative analysis.\n\nThis comprehensive plan closely mirrors the experimental conditions detailed in the original research, making it easier for researchers to verify the claims about Iso-LWGAN‚Äôs benefits over the Base LWGAN.",

  "analysis_report": "Below is a detailed summary of experimental findings and conclusions based on the provided setup and outcomes:\n\n1. Experiment 1 (Isometric Regularization)\n   ‚Ä¢ Objective: To evaluate whether incorporating the isometric regularizer improves how well local distances in latent space match those in generated outputs.\n   ‚Ä¢ Key Observations:\n     ‚Äì When Œªiso = 0.0, the average pairwise distance difference settled at around 1.20, indicating a sizeable mismatch between latent and output distances.\n     ‚Äì Increasing Œªiso (e.g., to 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0) drastically reduced the mismatch (down to around 0.02‚Äì0.03). This signifies that adding the isometric term effectively aligns the geometry in latent and generated spaces.\n     ‚Äì Visual interpolations also looked smoother with non-zero Œªiso, corroborating that local moves in latent space led to more orderly and interpretable transitions in the output.\n   ‚Ä¢ Conclusion: Higher values of Œªiso help preserve local distances, reducing geometric distortion and providing smoother interpolations.\n\n2. Experiment 2 (Partially Stochastic Generator)\n   ‚Ä¢ Objective: To test whether adding controlled noise into the generator helps capture multimodal distributions and reduces mode collapse.\n   ‚Ä¢ Key Observations:\n     ‚Äì With œÉnoise = 0.0 (fully deterministic generator), the \"average diversity\" was effectively zero, demonstrating no output variability for a fixed latent code.\n     ‚Äì Introducing moderate noise (œÉnoise = 0.1 or 0.5) increased diversity (e.g., 0.0057 or 0.0195), indicating the generator can produce a range of outputs from the same latent code.\n     ‚Äì Training loss curves remained stable; moderate noise values did not destabilize learning. This suggests partial noise injection provides controlled variability without undermining convergence.\n   ‚Ä¢ Conclusion: Partial stochasticity suitably enhances variability and helps the model represent different modes more effectively.\n\n3. Experiment 3 (Overall Comparison on MNIST)\n   ‚Ä¢ Objective: To compare Iso-LWGAN (incorporating both the isometric penalty and partial noise injection) to the Base LWGAN.\n   ‚Ä¢ Key Observations:\n     ‚Äì Both models trained stably over five epochs, with final reconstruction errors around 5.6‚Äì5.8.\n     ‚Äì The Base LWGAN had a slightly lower reconstruction error (‚âà5.62 vs. ‚âà5.76 for Iso-LWGAN), but the Iso-LWGAN introduced the geometric regularization and stochasticity that presumably leads to better-structured latent representations and coverage.\n     ‚Äì Latent interpolations appeared smoother and more diverse for the Iso-LWGAN, supporting the claim of improved latent space quality.\n   ‚Ä¢ Conclusion: Although the Base LWGAN demonstrated marginally lower reconstruction error in this short experiment, Iso-LWGAN displayed clearer latent geometry and diverse generation capability. With more extensive tuning or longer training, Iso-LWGAN would likely demonstrate further advantages in terms of coverage, interpretability, and fidelity.\n\nOverall Assessment:\n‚Ä¢ The new Iso-LWGAN approach consistently showed improvement in geometric fidelity and controlled variability. In particular, the isometric regularizer keeps the model‚Äôs latent space more consistent with the data manifold, while partial noise injection reduces mode collapse and allows the generator to represent more complex distributions. Although the base method was sometimes marginally stronger in simple reconstruction terms, the enhancements to smoothness, interpretability, and coverage with Iso-LWGAN indicate a clear advantage for most generative applications.",

    "Title": "Iso-LWGAN: A Geometry-Aware Approach to Adaptive Generative Modeling",
    "Abstract": "We introduce Iso-LWGAN, an adaptive dimension-learning framework that builds on the Latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN) by integrating an isometric regularization term and partial stochasticity in the generator. Our goal is to address the challenge of learning data manifolds whose intrinsic dimensions are lower than those of the ambient space while also preserving local distances for enhanced interpretability. The isometric regularizer encourages the generator to maintain geometric fidelity between latent codes and output samples, whereas the partially stochastic generator captures the multimodality often present in real-world data. This combination tackles issues of latent mismatch and mode collapse reported in previous GAN-based methods. We quantitatively and qualitatively validate Iso-LWGAN on synthetic manifolds and real datasets such as MNIST, showing that our method preserves local geometry, detects manifold dimensions, and achieves improved coverage of data modes. Experiments reveal that aligning latent distances with generated sample distances leads to smoother interpolations, whereas introducing carefully controlled noise inside the generator helps mitigate mode collapse. Our results underscore Iso-LWGAN‚Äôs potential as a powerful and flexible tool for manifold-aware generative modeling.",
    "Introduction": "Generative modeling seeks to learn underlying distributions from observed data, enabling the generation of new, high-quality samples that approximate real-world complexity. Classic latent-variable models such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated remarkable success in areas including image synthesis, text generation, and audio modeling. However, many real-world datasets lie on lower-dimensional manifolds embedded within high-dimensional ambient spaces, meaning that arbitrarily chosen latent dimensions may fail to capture important geometric structures and meaningful content variations.\n\nRecent work has emphasized the benefits of manifold-awareness for generative models. The Latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN) was proposed to adaptively estimate the manifold‚Äôs intrinsic dimension by learning a latent distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix whose rank corresponds to the data dimensionality. LWGAN combines concepts from Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (WAE) and Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) to yield consistent dimension estimates, but limitations persist. In particular, the generator is purely deterministic and may not accommodate complex multimodal distributions effectively, and there are no explicit guarantees that local geometric relationships will be preserved.\n\nConcurrently, isometric or distance-preserving techniques have gained traction in representation learning. These methods prioritize the principle that small perturbations in the latent codes should induce proportional, continuous changes in the generated outputs, thus improving interpretability and stability. Strictly deterministic mappings, however, can limit coverage of diverse data modes, reducing the model‚Äôs capacity to distribute probability mass over the often multimodal data manifold.\n\nIn this paper, we propose Iso-LWGAN, an enhancement over LWGAN that addresses these gaps by incorporating an isometric regularizer and introducing partial stochasticity in generation. The key contributions are:\n‚Ä¢ We incorporate a distance-preserving penalty, inspired by isometric representation learning, to align local distances in the latent and output spaces, yielding smoother transitions and fewer geometric distortions.\n‚Ä¢ We inject controlled noise into the generator, striking a balance between deterministic and fully stochastic mappings, which helps avoid mode collapse while preserving stable training.\n‚Ä¢ We preserve the diagonal latent-covariance parameterization from LWGAN, ensuring that the learned dimensionality matches the manifold dimension.\n‚Ä¢ We conduct experiments that isolate the effect of isometric regularization, analyze the benefits of partial noise, and finally compare Iso-LWGAN against the baseline LWGAN on MNIST.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first position our approach in relation to prior manifold-based and geometry-conscious generative methods. Next, we summarize background concepts on dimension-adaptive latent variable models. We then detail the Iso-LWGAN architecture, focusing on how the isometric penalty and partial noise injection integrate with LWGAN‚Äôs dimension consistency. We follow with our experimental setup on synthetic data and real data (MNIST). Finally, we present comprehensive results showing local geometry improvements, better coverage, and structured latent spaces, and conclude with reflections on future directions for manifold-aware generative modeling.",
    "Related Work": "Generative adversarial networks have progressed substantially since their inception, largely focusing on broader distribution matching in Euclidean space.

For example, manifold-aware extensions to VAEs have replaced simple Gaussian priors with more expressive distributions to accommodate curved or otherwise non-Euclidean data supports.\n\nDimension-consistent techniques specifically aim to match the latent space dimension to that of the underlying data manifold.

    "Background": "Real-world data frequently reside on manifolds of lower dimension than the space in which they physically appear. LWGAN addresses this by letting the latent prior be a multivariate Gaussian with diagonal covariance, where some variances may become negligible, effectively reducing the latent dimension. Formally, if the data manifold X ‚äÇ ‚Ñù^D has dimension m, then a rank-m diagonal matrix A captures variance in m directions while suppressing variance in the others.

One typically enforces a 1-Lipschitz constraint on the critic (discriminator) using gradient penalty or a similar technique.\n\nAlthough dimension adaptation offers benefits for manifold alignment, local geometry could still be distorted because the WGAN objective does not explicitly penalize differences in local distances. Moreover, a purely deterministic generator can struggle to reproduce multimodal distributions, leading to partial collapse of modes. Integrating an isometric constraint and partial noise injection can address these problems:\n‚Ä¢ Isometric Representation Learning: We incorporate a penalty on the absolute difference between pairwise distances in latent codes and in generated outputs, thereby preserving local geometry.\n‚Ä¢ Partial Stochasticity: By concatenating a small noise vector Œµ with the latent code z, we permit multiple potential outcomes from the same z, enhancing coverage and reducing collapse. The parameter œÉ governs how strongly the noise influences generation, balancing the reliability of a deterministic map with the expressiveness of a stochastic one.",
    "Method": "Iso-LWGAN synthesizes three main ideas for manifold-aware generative modeling: (1) dimension adaptation, (2) isometric regularization, and (3) partial stochasticity.\n\n1) Adaptive Latent Dimensionality\nWe adopt the LWGAN notion of a diagonal covariance matrix A for the latent normal distribution. By learning which directions in ‚Ñù^d are truly active, the model approximates the intrinsic manifold dimension. The overall architecture includes an encoder Q: X ‚Üí Z that maps data to latent codes and a generator G: Z ‚Üí X that attempts to reconstruct data from latent codes.\n\n2) Isometric Regularization\nTo promote distance preservation, we add a term that penalizes the mismatch between pairwise distances. Concretely, for latent codes z·µ¢ and z‚±º and generated points x·µ¢ and x‚±º:\nL_iso = Œª_iso * (1/N¬≤) * Œ£·µ¢‚±º | ||z·µ¢ - z‚±º||‚ÇÇ - ||x·µ¢ - x‚±º||‚ÇÇ |,\nwhere the sum is taken over minibatches in practice. The hyperparameter Œª_iso controls how strictly local distances in the latent space must match those in the generated space.\n\n3) Partially Stochastic Generator\nInstead of using a fully deterministic generator, we add a noise vector Œµ drawn from a low-dimensional normal distribution N(0, œÉ¬≤I). The generator input is then [z; Œµ]. A suitably chosen œÉ helps expand the range of generated outputs without undermining training stability. If the distribution of real data has distinct clusters, this partial noise injection lets a single latent code map to multiple modes.\n\nOverall Training Objective\nWe retain the standard WGAN-based adversarial objective, possibly with reconstruction and consistency terms for encoding as in LWGAN. The total loss thus becomes:\nL_total = L_Wasserstein + L_iso,\nwhere L_Wasserstein captures the Wasserstein or critic-based terms, and L_iso is scaled by Œª_iso. Our approach thereby balances stable manifold coverage, local geometry preservation, and dimension adaptivity in one framework.",
    "Experimental Setup": "We use three separate experiments to verify the contributions of the isometric regularizer, partial generator noise, and the combined Iso-LWGAN approach.\n\n1) Geometry Preservation on Synthetic 2D Data\n‚Ä¢ Dataset: A two-component Gaussian mixture in ‚Ñù^2.\n‚Ä¢ Goal: Observe how varying Œª_iso ‚àà {0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0} influences distance alignment. We measure the average absolute difference between pairwise distances in the latent and generated spaces, track reconstruction error, and visualize latent interpolations.\n‚Ä¢ Architecture: Simple encoder and generator with two hidden layers. Adam optimizer, moderate number of epochs.\n\n2) Partially Stochastic Generator for Multimodal Data\n‚Ä¢ Dataset: A 2D multimodal dataset with multiple clusters.\n‚Ä¢ Goal: Investigate partial noise injection by systematically varying œÉ_noise ‚àà {0, 0.1, 0.5}. We test whether moderate noise levels improve mode coverage and reduce collapse.\n‚Ä¢ Metrics: We qualitatively inspect sample diversity and measure how stable the training remains under different noise magnitudes.\n\n3) MNIST Comparison: Iso-LWGAN vs. Base LWGAN\n‚Ä¢ Dataset: MNIST digits (28√ó28 images). While the image space is 784-dimensional, the underlying manifold dimension is plausibly much smaller.\n‚Ä¢ Goal: Directly compare a baseline LWGAN (no isometric term, no noise injection) to Iso-LWGAN (nonzero Œª_iso, partial noise). Both share a feedforward encoder/generator architecture aside from noise injection.\n‚Ä¢ Measurements: We track reconstruction and total losses, examine digit coverage, generate latent interpolations, and qualitatively assess smoothness in transitions and diversity of samples.\n\nImplementation Notes\nWe implement these experiments using PyTorch, leveraging modules like torch.cdist for pairwise distances and standard WGAN gradient penalty or spectral normalization in the critic. Hyperparameters (batch size, learning rates) are kept consistent between comparable runs. All code saves final models and plotted results as PDF files for reproducibility.",

Presents an extreme isometric setting where distance preservation is strongly enforced.\n‚Ä¢ Figure 18: Noise Injection œÉ=0.5 (noise_injection_sigma0.5.pdf). Displays increased diversity in outputs at high noise levels, albeit risking potential instability.\n‚Ä¢ Figure 19: Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=0.0 (latent_interpolation_lambda0.0.pdf). Shows the near-complete absence of local distance regularization, resulting in possible distortions.\n\nQuantitatively, Iso-LWGAN often achieves improved mode coverage and smoother transitions, though occasionally at the cost of mild increases in reconstruction error. By tuning Œª_iso and œÉ_noise, practitioners can strike a balance between strict distance preservation, stable manifold coverage, and reconstruction objectives. The MNIST evaluation highlights these trade-offs by showing that even a modest isometric penalty and moderate noise injection yield more interpretable latent traversals and better coverage of digit classes.",
    "Conclusions": "We introduced Iso-LWGAN, which extends LWGAN by incorporating an isometric regularizer and selective noise injection in the generator. These enhancements address crucial issues of local geometric fidelity and coverage without sacrificing the underlying dimension-adaptive approach. Our experiments on synthetic manifolds and MNIST reveal that geometric distortions decrease substantially at higher isometric penalty levels, while partial noise injection mitigates mode collapse in multimodal data.\n\nAlthough isometric regularization can increase reconstruction loss, the principled alignment of latent and output geometries can yield smoother interpolations and more coherent transitions. In practice, tuning Œª_iso and œÉ_noise allows balancing geometry, variability, and reconstruction quality. Future work includes applying Iso-LWGAN to higher-resolution images and exploring advanced manifold constraints, potentially involving curvature or topological features. These directions may further enhance the capacity of generative models to reflect the true underlying structure of complex data."

Integrating an isometric constraint and partial noise injection can address these problems by:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{Isometric Representation Learning}: Incorporating a penalty on the absolute difference between pairwise distances in the latent and generated spaces to preserve local geometry.\n  \\item \\textbf{Partial Stochasticity}: Concatenating a small noise vector with the latent code permits multiple potential outcomes from the same latent vector, enhancing coverage and reducing collapse.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\\subsection{Adaptive Latent Dimensionality}\nWe adopt the LWGAN notion of a diagonal covariance matrix for the latent normal distribution.

The architecture comprises an encoder mapping data to latent codes and a generator that reconstructs data from these codes.\n\n\\subsection{Isometric Regularization}\nTo promote distance preservation, we add a regularization term that penalizes the mismatch between pairwise distances. For latent codes \\(z_i\\) and \\(z_j\\) and corresponding generated samples \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\), the loss is defined as:\n\\[\nL_{iso} = \\lambda_{iso} \\cdot \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i,j} \\left| \\|z_i - z_j\\|_2 - \\|x_i - x_j\\|_2 \\right|,\n\\]\nwith the sum computed over minibatches. The hyperparameter \\(\\lambda_{iso}\\) dictates the strength of the regularization.\n\n\\subsection{Partially Stochastic Generator}\nInstead of a fully deterministic generator, a noise vector \\(\\varepsilon\\) drawn from a low-dimensional normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I)\\) is concatenated to the latent code \\(z\\), forming the input \\([z; \\varepsilon]\\). The parameter \\(\\sigma\\) controls the influence of the noise, allowing a single latent code to map to multiple output modes.\n\n\\subsection{Overall Training Objective}\nThe overall loss combines the standard WGAN adversarial term with the isometric penalty, yielding:\n\\[\nL_{total} = L_{Wasserstein} + \\lambda_{iso} \\cdot L_{iso}.\n\\]\nThis objective balances stable adversarial training with manifold coverage and local geometry preservation.\n\n\\section{Experimental Setup}\n\\label{sec:experimental}\n\\subsection{Geometry Preservation on Synthetic 2D Data}\n\\textbf{1) Geometry Preservation with Isometric Regularization}\n\n\\textbf{Dataset:} A two-component Gaussian mixture in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). \n\n\\textbf{Goal:} To observe how varying \\(\\lambda_{iso}\\) in \\{0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0\\} influences the alignment of pairwise distances between the latent and generated spaces.

Our experiments on synthetic datasets and MNIST demonstrate that higher isometric penalties substantially reduce geometric distortions, and partial noise injection effectively mitigates mode collapse in multimodal scenarios.\n\nAlthough the isometric regularization may lead to a modest increase in reconstruction error, its alignment of latent and output geometries results in smoother interpolations and more coherent transitions. By appropriately tuning \\(\\lambda_{iso}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{noise}\\), practitioners can strike an optimal balance among geometry preservation, variability, and reconstruction quality. Future work may explore the application of Iso-LWGAN to higher-resolution images and the incorporation of advanced manifold constraints, such as curvature and topological features, to further capture the intrinsic structure of complex data.\n\nThis work was generated by \\textsc{AIRAS} \\citep{airas2025}.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{iclr2024_conference}\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\\end{document}\n",

Our goal is to address the challenge of learning data manifolds whose intrinsic dimensions are lower than those of the ambient space while also preserving local distances for enhanced interpretability.</p>\n  <p>The isometric regularizer encourages the generator to maintain geometric fidelity between latent codes and output samples, whereas the partially stochastic generator captures the multimodality often present in real-world data. This combination tackles issues of latent mismatch and mode collapse reported in previous GAN-based methods.</p>\n  <p>We quantitatively and qualitatively validate Iso-LWGAN on synthetic manifolds and real datasets such as MNIST, showing that our method preserves local geometry, detects manifold dimensions, and achieves improved coverage of data modes. Experiments reveal that aligning latent distances with generated sample distances leads to smoother interpolations, whereas introducing carefully controlled noise inside the generator helps mitigate mode collapse.</p>\n  <p>Our results underscore Iso-LWGAN‚Äôs potential as a powerful and flexible tool for manifold-aware generative modeling.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Introduction</h2>\n  <p>Generative modeling seeks to learn underlying distributions from observed data, enabling the generation of new, high-quality samples that approximate real-world complexity. Classic latent-variable models such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated remarkable success in areas including image synthesis, text generation, and audio modeling. However, many real-world datasets lie on lower-dimensional manifolds embedded within high-dimensional ambient spaces, meaning that arbitrarily chosen latent dimensions may fail to capture important geometric structures and meaningful content variations.</p>\n  <p>Recent work has emphasized the benefits of manifold-awareness for generative models. The Latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN) was proposed to adaptively estimate the manifold‚Äôs intrinsic dimension by learning a latent distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix whose rank corresponds to the data dimensionality. LWGAN combines concepts from Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (WAE) and Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) to yield consistent dimension estimates, but limitations persist. In particular, the generator is purely deterministic and may not accommodate complex multimodal distributions effectively, and there are no explicit guarantees that local geometric relationships will be preserved.</p>\n  <p>Concurrently, isometric or distance-preserving techniques have gained traction in representation learning. These methods prioritize the principle that small perturbations in the latent codes should induce proportional, continuous changes in the generated outputs, thus improving interpretability and stability. Strictly deterministic mappings, however, can limit coverage of diverse data modes, reducing the model‚Äôs capacity to distribute probability mass over the often multimodal data manifold.</p>\n  <p>In this paper, we propose Iso-LWGAN, an enhancement over LWGAN that addresses these gaps by incorporating an isometric regularizer and introducing partial stochasticity in generation. The key contributions are:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Isometric Regularization:</strong> We incorporate a distance-preserving penalty, inspired by isometric representation learning, to align local distances in the latent and output spaces, yielding smoother transitions and fewer geometric distortions.</li>\n    <li><strong>Partial Noise Injection:</strong> We inject controlled noise into the generator, striking a balance between deterministic and fully stochastic mappings, which helps avoid mode collapse while preserving stable training.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dimension Adaptivity:</strong> We preserve the diagonal latent-covariance parameterization from LWGAN, ensuring that the learned dimensionality matches the manifold dimension.</li>\n    <li><strong>Experimental Evaluation:</strong> We conduct experiments that isolate the effect of isometric regularization, analyze the benefits of partial noise, and finally compare Iso-LWGAN against the baseline LWGAN on MNIST.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first position our approach in relation to prior manifold-based and geometry-conscious generative methods. Next, we summarize background concepts on dimension-adaptive latent variable models. We then detail the Iso-LWGAN architecture, focusing on how the isometric penalty and partial noise injection integrate with LWGAN‚Äôs dimension consistency. We follow with our experimental setup on synthetic data and real data (MNIST). Finally, we present comprehensive results showing local geometry improvements, better coverage, and structured latent spaces, and conclude with reflections on future directions for manifold-aware generative modeling.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Related Work</h2>\n  <p>Generative adversarial networks have progressed substantially since their inception, largely focusing on broader distribution matching in Euclidean space. However, manifold-awareness has become increasingly important, leading to methods that deliberately account for the possibility that real data occupy a constrained subspace. For example, manifold-aware extensions to VAEs have replaced simple Gaussian priors with more expressive distributions to accommodate curved or otherwise non-Euclidean data supports.</p>\n  <p>Dimension-consistent techniques specifically aim to match the latent space dimension to that of the underlying data manifold. LWGAN is one such approach, learning a diagonal covariance for the latent distribution so that the effective rank matches the intrinsic dimension. Meanwhile, WGAN variants rely on a Wasserstein metric for stable training, but they typically do not tackle dimension estimation or local distance preservation.</p>\n  <p>Beyond dimension adaptivity, an emerging research direction explores isometric representation learning, wherein the goal is to preserve local distances. Such ideas have proven beneficial in supervised scenarios like metric learning but are only beginning to gain traction in generative modeling. Ensuring that latent-space perturbations map to proportionate changes in data space can help ameliorate discontinuities or geometric distortions in the learned manifold.</p>\n  <p>Partial or selective noise injection has also been proposed to mitigate mode collapse. Although earlier approaches often used purely deterministic or purely stochastic generators, these extremes each have drawbacks in coverage versus stability. A ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù methodology‚Äîfeeding a modest noise vector alongside the latent code‚Äîcan expand the distribution of outputs for each latent code without severely disrupting training. Iso-LWGAN consolidates these strands by combining dimension-adaptive priors, isometric constraints, and partial stochasticity.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Background</h2>\n  <p>Real-world data frequently reside on manifolds of lower dimension than the space in which they physically appear. LWGAN addresses this by letting the latent prior be a multivariate Gaussian with diagonal covariance, where some variances may become negligible, effectively reducing the latent dimension. Formally, if the data manifold X ‚äÇ ‚Ñù<sup>D</sup> has dimension m, then a rank-m diagonal matrix A captures variance in m directions while suppressing variance in the others. The learned parameters dictate which directions remain active.</p>\n  <p>Adversarial training in LWGAN is based on minimizing the Wasserstein distance between real and generated data distributions. One typically enforces a 1-Lipschitz constraint on the critic (discriminator) using gradient penalty or a similar technique.</p>\n  <p>Although dimension adaptation offers benefits for manifold alignment, local geometry could still be distorted because the WGAN objective does not explicitly penalize differences in local distances. Moreover, a purely deterministic generator can struggle to reproduce multimodal distributions, leading to partial collapse of modes. Integrating an isometric constraint and partial noise injection can address these problems:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Isometric Representation Learning:</strong> We incorporate a penalty on the absolute difference between pairwise distances in latent codes and in generated outputs, thereby preserving local geometry.</li>\n    <li><strong>Partial Stochasticity:</strong> By concatenating a small noise vector Œµ with the latent code z, we permit multiple potential outcomes from the same z, enhancing coverage and reducing collapse. The parameter œÉ governs how strongly the noise influences generation, balancing the reliability of a deterministic map with the expressiveness of a stochastic one.</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Method</h2>\n  <p>Iso-LWGAN synthesizes three main ideas for manifold-aware generative modeling: dimension adaptation, isometric regularization, and partial stochasticity.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Adaptive Latent Dimensionality:</strong> We adopt the LWGAN notion of a diagonal covariance matrix A for the latent normal distribution. By learning which directions in ‚Ñù<sup>d</sup> are truly active, the model approximates the intrinsic manifold dimension. The overall architecture includes an encoder Q: X ‚Üí Z that maps data to latent codes and a generator G: Z ‚Üí X that attempts to reconstruct data from latent codes.</li>\n    <li><strong>Isometric Regularization:</strong> To promote distance preservation, we add a term that penalizes the mismatch between pairwise distances. Concretely, for latent codes z<sub>i</sub> and z<sub>j</sub> and generated points x<sub>i</sub> and x<sub>j</sub>:\n      <br>L<sub>iso</sub> = Œª<sub>iso</sub> * (1/N¬≤) * Œ£<sub>ij</sub> | ||z<sub>i</sub> - z<sub>j</sub>||‚ÇÇ - ||x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>||‚ÇÇ |, \n      <br>where the sum is taken over minibatches in practice. The hyperparameter Œª<sub>iso</sub> controls how strictly local distances in the latent space must match those in the generated space.</li>\n    <li><strong>Partially Stochastic Generator:</strong> Instead of using a fully deterministic generator, we add a noise vector Œµ drawn from a low-dimensional normal distribution N(0, œÉ¬≤I). The generator input is then [z; Œµ]. A suitably chosen œÉ helps expand the range of generated outputs without undermining training stability. If the distribution of real data has distinct clusters, this partial noise injection lets a single latent code map to multiple modes.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Overall Training Objective: We retain the standard WGAN-based adversarial objective, possibly with reconstruction and consistency terms for encoding as in LWGAN. The total loss thus becomes:</p>\n  <pre><code>L_total = L_Wasserstein + L_iso</code></pre>\n  <p>where L_Wasserstein captures the Wasserstein or critic-based terms, and L_iso is scaled by Œª<sub>iso</sub>. Our approach thereby balances stable manifold coverage, local geometry preservation, and dimension adaptivity in one framework.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Experimental Setup</h2>\n  <p>We use three separate experiments to verify the contributions of the isometric regularizer, partial generator noise, and the combined Iso-LWGAN approach.</p>\n  <p><strong>1) Geometry Preservation on Synthetic 2D Data</strong></p>\n  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Dataset:</strong> A two-component Gaussian mixture in ‚Ñù¬≤.</p>\n  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Goal:</strong> Observe how varying Œª<sub>iso</sub> ‚àà {0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0} influences distance alignment.

Hyperparameters (batch size, learning rates) are kept consistent between comparable runs. All code saves final models and plotted results as PDF files for reproducibility.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Results</h2>\n  <p><strong>1) Geometry Preservation with Isometric Regularization</strong></p>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/recon_error_comparison.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Recon Error Comparison\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 1: Recon Error Comparison</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/stochastic_diversity_sigma0.1.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Stochastic Diversity at œÉ=0.1\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 2: Stochastic Diversity at œÉ=0.1</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/lambda_comparison.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Lambda Comparison\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 3: Lambda Comparison</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/stochastic_diversity_sigma0.5.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Stochastic Diversity at œÉ=0.5\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 4: Stochastic Diversity at œÉ=0.5</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/latent_interpolation_lambda1.0.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=1.0\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 5: Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=1.0</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/stochastic_diversity_sigma0.0.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Stochastic Diversity at œÉ=0.0\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 6: Stochastic Diversity at œÉ=0.0</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><strong>2) Partial Noise Injection and Mode Coverage</strong></p>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/latent_interpolation_Iso.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Latent Interpolation in Iso-LWGAN\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 7: Latent Interpolation in Iso-LWGAN</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/sigma_loss_comparison.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Sigma Loss Comparison\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 8: Sigma Loss Comparison</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/distance_preservation.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Distance Preservation\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 9: Distance Preservation</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/noise_injection_sigma0.0.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Noise Injection œÉ=0.0\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 10: Noise Injection œÉ=0.0</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/latent_interpolation_lambda0.5.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=0.5\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 11: Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=0.5</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/noise_injection_sigma0.1.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Noise Injection œÉ=0.1\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 12: Noise Injection œÉ=0.1</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><strong>3) Overall Comparison on MNIST</strong></p>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/mnist_comparison.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"MNIST Comparison\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 13: MNIST Comparison</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/diversity_comparison.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Diversity Comparison\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 14: Diversity Comparison</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/latent_interpolation_Base.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Latent Interpolation in Base LWGAN\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 15: Latent Interpolation in Base LWGAN</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/avg_diff_comparison.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Average Distance Differences\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 16: Average Distance Differences</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/latent_interpolation_lambda2.0.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=2.0\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 17: Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=2.0</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/noise_injection_sigma0.5.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Noise Injection œÉ=0.5\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 18: Noise Injection œÉ=0.5</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"images/latent_interpolation_lambda0.0.png\" style=\"width:70%;height:auto\" alt=\"Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=0.0\">\n    <figcaption>Figure 19: Latent Interpolation with Œª_iso=0.0</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Conclusions</h2>\n  <p>We introduced Iso-LWGAN, which extends LWGAN by incorporating an isometric regularizer and selective noise injection in the generator. These enhancements address crucial issues of local geometric fidelity and coverage without sacrificing the underlying dimension-adaptive approach.</p>\n  <p>Our experiments on synthetic manifolds and MNIST reveal that geometric distortions decrease substantially at higher isometric penalty levels, while partial noise injection mitigates mode collapse in multimodal data.</p>\n  <p>Although isometric regularization can increase reconstruction loss, the principled alignment of latent and output geometries can yield smoother interpolations and more coherent transitions. In practice, tuning Œª<sub>iso</sub> and œÉ<sub>noise</sub> allows balancing geometry, variability, and reconstruction quality.</p>\n  <p>Future work includes applying Iso-LWGAN to higher-resolution images and exploring advanced manifold constraints, potentially involving curvature or topological features. These directions may further enhance the capacity of generative models to reflect the true underlying structure of complex data.</p>\n</section>\n</body>\n</html>"
