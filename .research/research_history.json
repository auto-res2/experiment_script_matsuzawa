The method enforces adherence to the Fokker-Planck equation, enhancing semantic characteristics and mitigating image generation artifacts.",
    "methodology": "Characteristic guidance corrects classifier-free guidance by incorporating a non-linear correction term (∆x) derived from the Fokker-Planck equation using the method of characteristics and a harmonic ansatz. This involves iteratively solving a fixed-point equation to determine ∆x, using accelerated fixed-point iteration algorithms and projection operators for regularization and faster convergence.",
    "experimental_setup": "The method was evaluated on conditional Gaussian distributions, mixtures of Gaussians, simulations of magnet phase transitions (Landau-Ginzburg model), and image generation tasks using CIFAR-10, ImageNet 256 (with latent diffusion models), and Stable Diffusion. Evaluation metrics included KL divergence, Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and visual inspection.",
    "limitations": "The effectiveness of FID as an evaluation metric is compromised due to the discrepancy between target conditional probabilities and marginal probabilities. The iterative computation of the non-linear correction term can be slow, and the method's performance relies on the harmonic ansatz, which may not hold in all scenarios.",

  "new_method": "Below is one possible new method (step 3), constructed by blending insights from the Base Method (Characteristic Guidance) and an approach in the Add Method (specifically, advanced numerical simulation techniques). It is deliberately more than just a minor tweak of the Base Method, addressing several of its pitfalls with a fundamentally different algorithmic structure.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nNovel Method Proposal: “Adaptive Characteristic Simulation (ACS)”\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Overview of ACS:\n   • Keep the main idea of non-linear correction in classifier-free guidance via characteristic curves.  \n   • Completely replace the original iterative fixed-point solver with a tailored, multi-stage numerical simulation inspired by Purify++’s advanced ODE/SDE techniques.  \n   • Introduce an adaptive step size scheduling mechanism that dynamically controls both the magnitude of the non-linear correction and the random perturbations used during sampling.\n\n2. Key Components:\n   a) Adaptive Non-linear Simulation:\n      • Instead of resolving the Fokker-Planck–based correction term purely through repeated fixed-point iteration, ACS re-casts the correction step as an SDE integrating forward in “color-coded stages.”  \n      • Each stage focuses on a portion of the trajectory deemed high-variance or prone to distribution drift. This replaces the harmonic ansatz with a data-driven approach that corrects drift based on the local properties of samples still being denoised.\n\n   b) Staged Step Size Scheduling:\n      • Like Purify++’s carefully tuned ODE steps, ACS uses smaller integration steps in regions of high curvature (large gradient changes from the classifier-free guidance) and larger steps where the model is more linear.  \n      • This scheduling reduces the number of total iterations while improving precision in challenging parts of the diffusion trajectory.\n\n   c) Controlled Random Perturbations:\n      • Borrow the concept from Purify++ of mixing an ODE perspective (precise deterministic correction) with slight stochastic “bumps” to handle unpredictable drift.  \n      • These perturbations are automatically tuned via an error-estimation heuristic, so that ACS does not depend on a fixed level of randomness. This relaxes reliance on a single analytic assumption (like the harmonic ansatz) and provides better robustness to out-of-distribution samples.\n\n3. Advantages Over the Base Method:\n   • By replacing the harmonic ansatz–based fixed-point iteration with a multi-stage adaptive simulation, ACS shrinks the computational burden and mitigates the risk of getting stuck or diverging during large guidance scales.  \n   • The randomized but carefully controlled corrections capture non-linear effects more flexibly than a purely deterministic approach, especially in high-dimensional or complex data regimes.  \n   • The staged scheduling gives fine-grained control over each segment of the diffusion process, reducing the vulnerability to distribution mismatch and increasing interpretability for tuning.\n\nIn sum, ACS is “truly new” because it transforms how the non-linear correction is computed—altering both the solver’s form (staged SDE integration) and the type of randomness introduced (adaptively mixed noise)—a clear departure from simply tweaking the Base Method’s fixed-point iteration or harmonic ansatz.",
  "verification_policy": "Below is an outline of an experimental plan in which I propose up to three realistic experiments (all implementable in Python) to validate that ACS outperforms the Base Method:\n\n1. Testing the Adaptive Step Size Scheduler with Synthetic Diffusion Trajectories  \n   • Description: Create a set of synthetic non-linear diffusion trajectories (for example, using simple differential equations with known regions of high curvature) and simulate both the Base Method’s fixed-step integration versus ACS’s adaptive step size scheduler.  \n   • Implementation:  \n  – Code these trajectories using Python’s numerical libraries (e.g., NumPy and SciPy’s ODE solvers).  \n  – Implement the adaptive scheduling mechanism that adjusts the step size based on local gradient magnitude or curvature.  \n   • Metrics: Compare the number of iterations required to reach a given error tolerance and the overall computational time. Monitor error trajectories over time to validate that adaptive stepping leads to faster convergence and improved precision in high-curvature regions.\n\n2. Evaluating the Controlled Random Perturbations in the SDE Integration  \n   • Description: Simulate a stochastic differential equation (SDE) problem (or use a noise-perturbed dynamical system) to test whether ACS’s mechanism of adaptively tuning the random perturbation intensity improves robustness.  \n   • Implementation:  \n  – Code the SDE simulation using libraries such as NumPy and, if higher-level integration routines are needed, packages like SciPy or specialized SDE solvers available in Python.  \n  – Compare a version with fixed noise intensity (mirroring the Base Method’s assumption) versus ACS’s adaptive noise control based on local error estimation.  \n   • Metrics: Evaluate metrics such as the variance of the resulting trajectories and the recovery from distribution shocks (e.g., when unexpected noise bursts occur). This experiment should demonstrate that an adaptive, bounded random perturbation strategy reduces divergence risks and improves stability over a wide range of scenarios.\n\n3. End-to-End Performance Comparison on a Benchmark Task  \n   • Description: Implement both the Base Method and ACS for a representative denoising or diffusion-based task (for instance, a simplified version of a classifier-free guidance scenario on synthetic or low-dimensional data).  \n   • Implementation:  \n  – Simulate the complete diffusion process under both methods by coding the iterative correction steps in Python, using the staged simulation approach for ACS and the original fixed-point iteration for the Base Method.  \n  – Use common visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib) to trace the diffusion paths and errors over time.  \n   • Metrics: Compare run times, convergence metrics, control over randomness (stability under varying conditions), and overall quality of the recovered data (using quantitative estimates such as error norms or qualitative assessments via plotting). This ensemble evaluation will provide a clear comparison in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, highlighting the benefits of the ACS’s multi-stage adaptive integration approach.\n\nEach of these experiments is designed with realistic Python implementations in mind—leveraging standard numerical libraries and simulation frameworks. Together they provide a comprehensive evaluation of how and why ACS, with its adaptive simulation, staged step size control, and controlled randomness, potentially outperforms the traditional Base Method.",
  "experiment_details": "Below is a detailed experimental plan that follows the “Verification Policy” requirements. In what follows, we describe three experiments that are designed to compare the Base Method (with fixed‐step integration and fixed noise intensity) and the proposed adaptive integration scheme (ACS), which incorporates an adaptive step size scheduler and controlled random perturbations. In each experiment we describe the scientific concept, the concrete implementation details (assuming a PyTorch-based environment along with standard Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib), and provide example code snippets. These experiments are organized so that any overlapping evaluation criteria (e.g. run time, error trajectory) are combined where appropriate, yet each experiment emphasizes a distinct aspect of the proposed improvements.\n\n────────────────────────────\nExperiment 1: Testing the Adaptive Step Size Scheduler with Synthetic Diffusion Trajectories\n\nDescription:\n• Objective: Validate that an adaptive step size scheduler can improve integration efficiency and accuracy for non-linear diffusion trajectories.  \n• Approach:  \n – We generate synthetic trajectories from a non-linear differential equation (for example, an equation with regions of high curvature) that mimics the diffusion process.  \n – We implement a “Base Method” using a fixed-step Euler integrator and an “ACS” method where the step size is adjusted on the fly using local error estimators (for example, based on the gradient magnitude or curvature).  \n• Metrics:  \n – Number of iterations required to achieve a given error tolerance.  \n – Total computational time.  \n – Evolution of the integration error along the trajectory.\n\nImplementation Details:\n• The ODE function will be defined in Python (for example, a sigmoid-like dynamics or a logistic-like function).  \n• For the fixed-step approach, a fixed delta t is used.  \n• For the adaptive variant, we estimate the local error by comparing a full step with two half steps (a standard adaptive control technique).  \n• We use SciPy’s ode integration routines as an inspiration, yet we explicitly code a simple adaptive integrator for clarity.  \n• PyTorch is not strictly required for this synthetic experiment but can be used to vectorize operations or later incorporate the method into a diffusion model.\n\nExample Code (Experiment 1):\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\n\ndef f(t, y):\n    # Non-linear dynamic: for example, a simple non-linear diffusion term with increased curvature near y=0\n    return -y + 0.5*np.tanh(10*y)\n\ndef fixed_step_integrator(y0, t0, tend, dt):\n    t_values = [t0]\n    y_values = [y0]\n    t = t0\n    y = y0\n    while t < tend:\n        y = y + dt * f(t, y)\n        t += dt\n        t_values.append(t)\n        y_values.append(y)\n    return np.array(t_values), np.array(y_values)\n\ndef adaptive_step_integrator(y0, t0, tend, dt_initial, tol):\n    t_values = [t0]\n    y_values = [y0]\n    t = t0\n    y = y0\n    dt = dt_initial\n    while t < tend:\n        # One full step\n        y_full = y + dt * f(t, y)\n        # Two half steps\n        dt_half = dt / 2.0\n        y_half = y + dt_half * f(t, y)\n        y_two_half = y_half + dt_half * f(t + dt_half, y_half)\n        # Estimate error\n        error = np.abs(y_full -

A simplified task—such as a low-dimensional denoising experiment or a lightweight classifier-free guidance example—is chosen to mirror aspects of the original CIFAR-10 UNet work while remaining computationally tractable for experimentation.  \n• Approach:  \n – Implement two sampling pipelines:\n  ∘ A Base pipeline performing fixed-step iterative corrections (following the DDIM sampling procedure with fixed variance parameters).  \n  ∘ An ACS pipeline that uses a multi-stage adaptive integration method (with both adaptive step size and noise adjustment).\n – The UNet architecture (a simplified version) is defined in PyTorch and used as the denoising network.\n – Both pipelines are run on either synthetic data or a subset of CIFAR-10 (or synthetic proxy data) for demonstration.\n• Metrics:  \n – Sampling run time and number of iterations.  \n – Convergence quality (e.g., using error norms between successive denoised images).  \n – Visual quality of the recovered images (using matplotlib for visual inspection) and quantitative FID-like estimates if available.\n\nImplementation Details:\n• Use PyTorch to implement the core components:\n – A simplified UNet (or a portion thereof) extracted from the original repository.\n – Training and sampling loops that mimic those in sample.py and train.py.\n• For the Base Method, the DDIM sampling with fixed “eta” (variance scaling) is performed.  \n• For the ACS method, the schedule for step size and noise levels is adjusted based on the current state’s error (for example, differences in predicted noise vs. actual noise).\n• Although a full training iteration may be computationally expensive, one can run a “toy” experiment on a small subset of data or even on synthetic images to illustrate the conceptual benefits.\n• Visualization is performed using matplotlib to overlay or compare sample trajectories and generated images side by side.\n\nExample Code (Experiment 3):\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# A simplified UNet-like block (for demonstration)\nclass SimpleUNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels=3, out_channels=3, features=64):\n        super(SimpleUNet, self).__init__()\n        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, features, kernel_size=3, padding=1),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Conv2d(features, features, kernel_size=3, padding=1),\n            nn.ReLU())\n        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(features, features, kernel_size=3, padding=1),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Conv2d(features, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1))\n        \n    def forward(self, x, t):\n        # t can be injected for time-conditioning if desired\n        encoded = self.encoder(x)\n        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)\n        return decoded\n\n# Dummy diffusion model sampling functions\ndef ddim_sample_base(model, x_init, num_steps=50, eta=0.0):\n    # Fixed-step DDIM sampling: note that this is a simplified simulation.\n    x = x_init.clone()\n    trajectory = [x.cpu().detach()]\n    dt = 1.0 / num_steps\n    for i in range(num_steps):\n        # Predict noise (here simulated via the UNet model)\n        noise_pred = model(x, torch.tensor([i*dt]))\n        # Fixed correction rule (a simple Euler step)\n        x = x -

Experiment 1 confirms the efficiency and precision benefits of adaptive step sizing on synthetic trajectories.\n2. Experiment 2 demonstrates that controlled adjustment of random perturbations in SDE integration can lead to more stable trajectories under noisy conditions.\n3. Experiment 3 offers an end-to-end sampling comparison on a diffusion task, clearly illustrating improvements in convergence and sample quality.\n\nEach experiment has been configured to use common Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, matplotlib) and is designed to minimize overlap while providing complementary insights into the performance gains achieved by ACS over the Base Method. These experiments not only validate the improvements but also show how to integrate adaptive methods into existing diffusion model frameworks.",

Experiment 1 uses a fixed-step Euler integrator and an adaptive integrator based on comparing one full step vs. two half steps. It prints the iteration counts and computational times. The resulting trajectories are saved to “synthetic_diffusion_trajectory.pdf”.\n2. Experiment 2 simulates an SDE (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process) using the Euler–Maruyama method. It compares a fixed noise scale (“Base”) with an adaptive variant (“ACS”) that lowers the noise intensity if a local error threshold is exceeded. The trajectory plot is saved as “sde_integration_controlled.pdf”.\n3. Experiment 3 demonstrates an end-to-end sampling comparison on a toy diffusion task using a simplified UNet. Both a fixed (DDIM-like) and an adaptive sampling procedure are run. Error trajectories and final sample images are plotted and saved with filenames “error_trajectory_base.pdf”, “error_trajectory_acs.pdf”, “final_sample_base.pdf”, and “final_sample_acs.pdf”.\n\nThe run_all_tests() function runs all experiments sequentially and prints a summary of execution time.
